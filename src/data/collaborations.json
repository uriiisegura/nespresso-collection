			"This is not the first collaboration between the two parties. Chiara Ferragni's appeal to Nespresso is clear. Not only does she have a large audience as influencer, it is hard not to be impressed with her achievements being only mid 30s. What started out as a blog in 2009, she grow to a million-dollar business. She is recognized for her entrepreneurial spirit and business insight launching her own product lines and levering collaborations. In 2017, she reached the #1 spot in the Forbes' Top Influencers list in the Fashion category. In the dynamic industry of influencers, Ferragni has managed to grow her brand and remain relevant for well over a decade.",
			"In 2021, Ferragni designed machines and mugs for Nespresso, at the time there even was a pop-up store for 2 months in Milan. The main theme at that time was cotton-candy pink and her emoji-like eye logo was prominently shown. Where those earlier designs seem more playful and girly, it is safe to say this years designs will appeal to a broader audience.",
			"The design of the sleeves breathe a more luxurious vibe with a diamond-shaped pattern of black, green and gold. The capsule is inspired by the Villa Necchi Campiglio whose door motif is the diamond pattern that shapes the whole design. The villa was designed by Piero Portaluppi, led by the motto \"Faire sans dire\" which means to do without saying. His architeture is always quite refined and discrete, and the main colors of the villa are green and gold. As Italian he was really superstitious and this colors evocate to luck and hope."
