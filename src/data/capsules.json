			"This coffee uses the Split Roast technique. The majority of the coffee is medium roasted, while the minority, composed of the robusta portion, is roasted to a very dark degree. Both splits achieve this profile with a medium-long roast.",
			"Ispirazione Italiana Milano Intenso is a celebration of this vibrant city. Mostly Latin American coffees, the medium-dark roast brings out the dark cocoa and toasted cereal notes, finding a balance with the jammy fruity note and shimmer of spice. The design of this limited-edition collection represents Chiara Ferragni's vision of Milan as a place of artistic heritage, a luxurious lifestyle, and timeless elegance."
