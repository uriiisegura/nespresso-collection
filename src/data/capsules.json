			"Ispirazione Italiana Milano Intenso is a celebration of this vibrant city. Mostly Latin American coffees, the medium-dark roast brings out the dark cocoa and toasted cereal notes, finding a balance with the jammy fruity note and shimmer of spice. The design of this limited-edition collection represents Chiara Ferragni's vision of Milan as a place of artistic heritage, a luxurious lifestyle, and timeless elegance.",

			"As they would in Milan, enjoy Milano Intenso as a macchiato, a quick moment of indulgence in the fast paced and vibrant city. A complex split roast brings out toasted cereal notes from a dark roast on the robusta and preserves its balance with a medium roast on the Arabica portion.",
			"A touch of frothed milk over the espresso to soften bitterness and heightens the cocoa notes from the Arabica."

			"Cloudberries grow across the arctic tundra in particularly cold climate. The Nordics enjoy the delicate tart taste of this little golden-yellow berry, particularly in their jams and desserts. This delicacy inspired our Variations Nordic Cloudberry Flavoured coffee. It has all the roundness of the Livanto base with a sweet jammy fruitiness and a hint of acidity.",

			"A medium roasting accentuates malted notes, whilst fruity notes evolve to create a complex and delicate caramelised bouquet."
