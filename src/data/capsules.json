			"Ispirazione Italiana Milano Intenso is a celebration of this vibrant city. Mostly Latin American coffees, the medium-dark roast brings out the dark cocoa and toasted cereal notes, finding a balance with the jammy fruity note and shimmer of spice. The design of this limited-edition collection represents Chiara Ferragni's vision of Milan as a place of artistic heritage, a luxurious lifestyle, and timeless elegance.",
			"It was released at the start of 2023 as part of the collaboration between Nespresso and Chiara Ferragni, an Italian fashion blogger, model and fashion designer. This collab entails new designs on coffee machines, gold coloured accessories and this coffee, which is intended as espresso or ristretto."

			"This coffee uses the Split Roast technique. The majority of the coffee is medium roasted, while the minority, composed of the robusta portion, is roasted to a very dark degree. Both splits achieve this profile with a medium-long roast.",
			"For this capsule we use mostly Latin American coffee."
		],
		"serving": [
			"As they would in Milan, enjoy Milano Intenso as a macchiato, a quick moment of indulgence in the fast paced and vibrant city. A complex split roast brings out toasted cereal notes from a dark roast on the robusta and preserves its balance with a medium roast on the Arabica portion.",
			"A touch of frothed milk over the espresso to soften bitterness and heightens the cocoa notes from the Arabica."
